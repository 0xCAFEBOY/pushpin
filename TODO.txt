## In progress
Allow gifs

## Technical
Figure out less verbose approach for redux

## Functional
Scale image down by default if it's large
Copy image data into specific storage location
Grab and save image filename
Receive image by native file finder
Receive image by drag and drop
Design and fix pointer types
Figure out real semantics for size of cards changing with text
Can't correctly select text within card - moves instead?
Delete with empty note deletes card
More robust way to handle max window size etc.
Seperate color bar, white cards
Cards created with random color
Can do basic text formatting with b/i/u
More advanced text formatting

Drag box to select and drag multiple cards[tried, got stuck]
Hold space to pan [tried, got stuck]

## Styling
More appealing background with dots
