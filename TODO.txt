## In progress
Upload and save image

## Technical
Figure out how to async actions around images like checking if file exists and getting sizes
Consider copying image data into specific storage location, grab filename

## Functional
Design and fix pointer types
Figure out real semantics for size of cards changing with text
Can't correctly select text within card - moves instead?
Delete with empty note deletes card
More robust way to handle max window size etc.
Seperate color bar, white cards
Cards created with random color
Can do basic text formatting with b/i/u
More advanced text formatting
Drag box to select and drag multiple cards
Hold space to pan [tried, got stuck]

## Styling
More appealing background with dots
